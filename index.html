    <h2>Howdy.</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Fine day, today. There's nothing like a blank page, waiting for you to type onto. Makes you feel like a toddler writing a thesis. Luckily, I’ve done enough typing to know where to begin.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Python is my staple.</span> Mostly for automation tasks. And boy, does it pack one heck of a punch, programmatically. It's how I got into technical tasking really. I even attended bootcamp classes to polish my skills at it. I self-teach too, to stay current with the tides of the coding world. If you’ve got tedious workflows, data scraping, or custom automations that need a brain (and a script), I’m your guy.</p>

      <p>Alongside Python I also work with <span class="highlight">Node.js and Rust.</span> Picked them up after exploring the backend rabbit hole. I’ve used both stacks in a few scraping and automation projects—they're lean, fast, and to the point.</p>

      <p>Lately, I’ve been doing some <span class="highlight">tech whispering—AKA documentation.</span> Technical writing beckoned and I heeded the call. Turns out I’m good at turning jargon as clear as muddy water into something even your non-tech uncle could grasp. From explaining codebases to outlining workflows, I make technical stuff feel less... hostile.</p>

      <p>And yeah—you probably noticed I inject a bit of personality into my job-seeking ads. That’s because I give a damn. I care about the work, the people, the outcome.</p>

      <p>I usually sync better with folks on the East Coast, Mid West, and Europe than West Coast folks—something about timezones, I guess. My timezone is <strong>UTC +3</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Other details you should know:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I’ll gladly sign NDAs and contracts.</li>
        <li>I’m open to NSFW gigs. Legally, ethically sound of course.</li>
        <li>I accept payment via <strong>Veem, PayPal, Remitly,</strong> and <strong>crypto</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If your day’s clogged with repeat tasks, broken workflows, or backend issues—pass it my way. I’ll script it, document it, and hand it back cleaner than I found it.</p>

      <p>Looking forward to the pleasure of doing business wit'cha.</p>

      <p><strong>Ta.</strong></p>
